To ensure a positive and enjoyable experience for everyone, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Follow Discord's TOS and Community Guidelines**

  You must follow [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), just as this server does, and any violations will be dealt with appropriately.

2. **Respectful Behavior**

  Be mindful of others! Treat everyone with respect. Don't be rude, disrespectful or otherwise unkind towards others.

  Be the best you, and avoid creating a toxic environment!

3. **Don't overload the channels with spam!**

  To be able to properly communicate you are not allowed to flood the channels with messages. We ask that you limit the amount of messages you send so that it is easier to read, and for others to participate in the conversation. This does not apply to bot channels.

4. **No Sensitive Topics!**

  We want everyone to feel comfortable on our server. As a result, we ask that you abstain from posting photos, links, or information that is inappropriate for minors, as well as refrain from discussing religion or politics. These issues frequently generate a lot of discussion and controversy.

5. **No Profane Language**

  We ask that you don't swear in our server, or keep it to a minimum.

  Profane language that may be homophobic, racist or otherwise hateful will be seen down upon and punished accordingly.

6. **No Malicious Content**

  There will be no grabify links, viruses, crash videos, virus links, or token grabbers. These actions will result in an automatic ban.

7. **Respect Privacy And Do Not *Doxx***

  Avoid sharing sensitive personal information, such as home addresses, phone numbers, or financial details.
Refrain from sharing or seeking out personal information about other members without their consent. [Doxxing](https://cyberbullying.org/doxing-and-cyberbullying) can have serious consequences.


> ***We reserve the right to change/modify or alter the rules at any point. As rules can't cover every scenario, our staff team have been given full permission to punish you based on their assessment of the situation, and you may be be punished as they see fit.***

## Reporting Issues

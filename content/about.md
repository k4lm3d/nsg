We're a group of 🇵🇭 Filipino gamers from [CyberCode Online](https://cybercodeonline.com) and [Arclight City](https://arclightcity.net), where we've established the ***Nousagi [NSG]*** gang.

But we're not stopping there!

🏗️ We're building a community for all Filipino gamers, regardless of their game of choice. 🎮 

Here's what we offer:

- 🫴 **A place to connect with other Filipino gamers:** Find new friends, discuss your favorite games, and share your gaming experiences.

- 🫴 **Support for Filipino gamers in various games:** We aim to establish Nousagi groups in many games, providing a sense of community and camaraderie within the Filipino gaming scene.

- 🫴 **A relaxed and friendly environment:** Come hang out, chat, and enjoy the company of fellow Filipino gamers. 

*Anyone is welcome to join, regardless of age, as long as they follow our rules, [guidelines](/gaming-guidelines), and [protocols](/hop-protocol).*

Let's build a strong and vibrant Filipino gaming community together! 💪
